[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6e45d654-6695-4761-9e66-aeb5cf17ee93/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/path-pilot/deploys)

Ever wondered how Google Maps always knows the "best" route from Point A to Point B? At the core is a pathfinding algorithm in action.

PathPilot allows you to interact with various pathfinding algorithms and learn how they work in practice!
